# Project to detect landmines using machine learning and/or advance image procesing techniques and/or recent multimodal LLMs

This project aims to develop a system for detecting land mines using advanced machine learning algorithms, image processing techniques, and potentially leveraging recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs). The goal is to create a reliable and efficient method for identifying land mines in various environments to enhance safety and aid in demining efforts.

## Datasets

For a comprehensive list of available datasets (Academic, Research, and Roboflow), please refer to [dataset.md](dataset.md).

- **Primary Sources:**
  - Academic/Research Papers (MineInsight, Hyperspectral benchmarks, etc.)
  - Roboflow (MineGuard-Thermal, various optical datasets)


## Project Goals:
- Proof of Concept: Demonstrate the feasibility of using ML/DL techniques for land mine detection.
- Develop a prototype system/workflow that can accurately identify land mines in images.
- Images are from UAV and can be optical, thermal or hyperspectral.
- Scalable solution, which is also robust to be upgraded with more advanced AI technology

## Methodology of ML/DL/GenAI
